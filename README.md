# Mars Data Web Scraping and Analysis Challenge

Overview

This challenge involves web scraping and data analysis of Mars-related datasets. Using Splinter, BeautifulSoup, and Pandas, I extracted Mars news articles and weather data, then analyzed temperature patterns, atmospheric pressure variations and the length of a Martian year.

Python Libraries Used
	•	BeautifulSoup (for web scraping)
	•	Splinter (for automated browser navigation)
	•	Pandas (for data manipulation)
	•	Matplotlib (for data visualization)
	•	NumPy & SciPy (for numerical analysis)

Key Features
Part 1- Mars News Scraping
	•	Extracts article titles and preview texts from a Mars news website.
	•	Stores results in a JSON file.

Part 2- Mars Weather Scraping and Analysis
	•	Scrapes weather data (e.g., temperature, pressure, dates).
	•	Converts Earth dates to Martian sols.
	•	Identifies coldest and hottest months based on minimum temperature.
	•	Finds months with the highest and lowest atmospheric pressure.
	•	Estimates the length of a Martian year.

Results
Results and some data analysis questions answered can be found in the part 1 and part 2 jupyter notebooks.
